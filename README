This is a library that implements encoding and parsing of DNS queries
and responses, per RFC 1035.

Documentation of library functions is found in rfc1035.h, along with
the declarations of those functions.  They are implemented in rfc1035.c

testdns.c is a simple program for doing a query and looking at the result.

check_dnsauth.c is a more complex example; it acts as a Nagios check
and will query a set of nameservers and verify their consistency.

See TODO for caveats.

This is GPL'ed.
